This algo is written in C# program. 
It is a mean-reverting algo designed to trade Nasdaq future.
It is designed to trade from 6:00 pm EST to 09:30 am EST right before new york regular trading hours.
It includes Asian and Euro time zones.
To use it you need to hook it up with your brokerage API. 
I am using ninjatrader/8 to run this algo.
Number of contracts per trades, profit target and stop loss can be fed as an input.
Bactesting results are also included in repository.
Enjoy!
